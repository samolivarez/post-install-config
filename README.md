<p>
Working from Virtual Machine remote access thru Microsoft Azure, the Admin will work from their osTickt admin panel to begin creating roles. In the image above a new "Supreme Admin" role is created.

<p>
Next and still in the admin panel, the "User" settings are established. In the above image, we have chosen to not require a "user" to register in order to create tickets.

Next, is the addition of new "Agents". The above image shows the addition of an "Agent" named "Jane Doe" and the creation of their respective access credentials. Please note: "Agents" and "User" credentials are fictitious and created for the sole purpose of this project demonstration. Access credentials have all since been disabled.
